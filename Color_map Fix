The only problem that i had found when i uploaded this file was that the Color color_map did not like being passed as a parameter. the fix for this is pretty simple, any functions that call color_map must have it as a constant parameter since it is a constant variable. 
for example:

	void draw_field(RectangleShape cell, RenderWindow& window, int height_count, int width_count, int field[][10], int cell_size, const Color color_map[]);

	void draw_block(RectangleShape cell, RenderWindow& window, const Color color_map[], int blockType, int block[][4][4], int curx, int cury, int cell_size);
	
	that is what those two functions should look like in the header file, just make it the same in the .cpp
	
	the game turns on and runs after you do that, however the go_down function does not work. this is because all of the variables passed into functions are localized int their scopes. IE they can only change the variables values inside the funciton, once the function has ended the values go back to whatever they were before they were passed in.
	
	i believe that the fix for this is to convert the function parameters to take in pointers instead of regular variables, that way the values can be changed.
	
	i did a lot of that but be aware, the Field[][] variable is being a pain, i cannot figure out how to pass it as a pointer.
